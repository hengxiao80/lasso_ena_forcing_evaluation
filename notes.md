# Forcing data evaluation

These are notes from working with the various of forcing datasets we prepared for LASSO ENA work.

## ERA5

- no surface radiative flux data in the data downloaded by Satoshi

## ERA5 EDA

## FNL

- FNL is supposed to be a better analysis than the operational GFS analysis. Because it contains more data that are not yet collected when operational analysis is done.
- But most of the variables are only avaliable every 6 hours.
- I couldn't find FNL datasets on the original model levels, only on the interpolated pressure levels.
- no cloud cover info though 

## GEFS


## MERRA2

- NASA's reanalysis product, successor of MERRA
- very modern data access system and very well documented
- "assimilated" is better than "analyzied" fields
